### <h2 align="center"> <i> <b> A Python script which automatically kills spotify ads</b> </i> </h2>

## How does it work?
It checks for window name changes and it'll exit spotify and relaunch it when spotify is playing "Advertisement".

## Why does it work
There's this known bug which let's you skip ads if you exit spotify entirely and relaunch it.

## Installing Dependencies 
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running the script
1. Exit Spotify entirely.
2. Open the directory in your preferred terminal.
3. Run `python main.py`.

## Warning
* There is a limitation however, some ads don't change the window title to "Advertisement". I might design a system which detects those too but I'm lazy atm.

## To-Do List
- [ ] Fix the bug
